# AWARE Client in Flutter

This is our new cross-platform AWARE client. We are using a highly-modular architecture which offers
flexibility in terms of AWARE-based applications, either built using Java, Kotlin in Android and
Swift for iOS for native development or just using Flutter Plugins in your Flutter-based applications.
